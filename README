geoip

Install any of the GeoIP database files.

* `geoip::file` : Definition to install any GeoIP database file.

There is no magic here, you need to have the Geo*.dat files available on
your puppetmaster somewhere, and reference them. This module is only a minor
convenience, since using the "file" type over and over with hardcoded
paths gets quite ugly.

Example :

    # In site.pp :
    Geoip::File {
        path        => '/usr/local/share',
        source_path => 'puppet:///modules/mymodule/GeoIP',
    }
    # For a node where nginx will have its geoip module enabled :
    geoip::file { 'GeoIP.dat': before => Class['nginx'] }
